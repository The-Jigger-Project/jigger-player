# The Jigger Project

Jigger is a music player that allows anyone to dynamically mix their ingame adaptive music based on trained machine learning algorithms or simply user preference for free.

## Ecosystem
The Jigger ecosystem has a different set of apps and SDKs designed to get you started.

- [Jigger Player](#): The staple player app for desktop that allows you to dynamically be your own dj of your ingame music, or play your favourite purchased game Soundtrack outside of the fun.

- [Liqueur](#): The **Liqueur** SDK is a set of libraries written in c++ that allow the communication of your favourite game engine with the Jigger player, developers can use the Liqueur SDK to integrate their games with the Jigger Player via Cocktail Cloud.

- [Cocktail Cloud](#): Connect with the cocktail cloud, upload your music samples and transform it to dynamic generative music ready to be published on the store, content creators are welcomed.

- Liqueur SDK integrations with Game Engines: **coming soon**
